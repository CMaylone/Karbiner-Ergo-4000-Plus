# Key Binding Changes

Note: Key swapping does not occur in Termianl or iTerm2.

| Key | Result |
|-----|--------|
| ```WIN + L``` | Display screensaver (to lock screen) |
| ```CMD and CTRL Swapped``` | CTRL + C works as expected |
| ```CMD + TAB and CTRL + TAB Swapped``` | ALT + Tab works as expected |
